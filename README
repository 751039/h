h

This is a small utility written in POSIX-compliant AWK that crawls
user-defined artist shoutboxes on last.fm and prints shouts published
throughout the day.

There is currently no way for you to parse past shouts, though.  I may
or may not add this functionality in the future.


dependencies
------------

h.awk uses the curl package to scrape web pages.


usage
-----

  $ ./h.awk

Let’s start by creating a directory that will later contain a file
named “artists”:

  $ mkdir -p "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/h"

It’s important to create a list of musicians whose shoutboxes we want
to check out:

  $ cat << EOF >> "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}h/artists"
  Nocturnal Emissions
  Cabaret Voltaire
  Current 93
  Bourbonese Qualk
  EOF

As shown in the following snippet, proper capitalization isn’t
required for the program to work correctly:

	    CURRENT 93
cabaRET voltAIre
    nocTURNal eMISSiONs

On January 26, 2026, h.awk produces the following output based on the
previously defined artists:

  $ ./h.awk
  h: fetching artist shoutboxes as of 2026-01-26
  h: processing 4 web pages...

As you can see, no one has posted anything on this date yet.

Some users may want to use emojis in their comments, so make sure you
have a font that supports Unicode.

On Debian GNU/Linux, you can install such a font this way:

  $ sudo apt-get install fonts-symbola

You may also need to rebuild the font cache after the installation is
complete:

  $ fc-cache -fv
